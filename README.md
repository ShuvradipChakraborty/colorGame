# This is my RGB picker project colorGame developed as part of the Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele.  
The course had us develop the project locally, but upon finishing the project I wanted to publish the project to my Github portfolio. GitHub is an important tool for developers and I want to make sure I use it frequently to get used to the software!

You can play the game at: https://westonludeke.github.io/colorGame. Thanks for reading!
